**Statistical Analysis**

Largemouth Bass were collected via nightlime electrofishing at 12 nearshore sites between Toledo and Huron, Ohio in the summer of 2016. We recorded total length (TL, mm), weight (g), sex, maturity, and collected otoliths for age and growth history analysis. This project currently consists of 4 main parts 1) determining bias and precision of age estimates, 2) creating and Age-Length key, 3) estimating annual mortality, and 4) building a von Bertalanffy growth model.
