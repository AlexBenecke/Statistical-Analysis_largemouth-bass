### Population Demographics of Largemouth Bass in Western Lake Erie

**Statistical Analysis**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data analyzed in this project was collected in conjuction with the Ohio Division of Wildlife's (ODW) annual nearshore community survey. The aim of this study is to help inform fisheries management by providing additional demographic information about the largemouth bass population in western Lake Erie. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The analysis presented here represent the work of a technichian being guided by ODW staff and are a learning excercise not a formal ODW report.*     

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Largemouth bass were collected via nighttime electrofishing at 12 nearshore sites between Toledo and Huron, Ohio during the summer of 2016. We recorded total length (TL, mm), weight (g), sex, maturity, and collected otoliths for age and growth history analysis. This project currently consists of 4 main parts 1) determining bias and precision of age estimates, 2) creating and Age-Length key, 3) estimating annual mortality, and 4) building a von Bertalanffy growth model.
